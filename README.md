# what?
This is a short series of solutions of a generative art tutorial (linked below).
The twist is that, while I'm "implementing" (moreso imitating) the solutions as intended in Javascript, I'm also going back and re-implementing them in Rust, using the Javascript as pseudocode.

# why?
I wanted to learn Javascript and Rust and do so as inefficently as possible. Really, I just miss working on art-oriented code. Following tutorials and actually doing the due diligence might be a way to get good at it!

In the unlikely event that I actually pick up skills to later be exploited for capital, then all the better.

# how?
That's gonna vary for each tutorial, but generally speaking, Javascript solutions are just gonna use the html ```canvas``` and  Javascript ```Math``` and Rust is going to use some combination of ```image```, ```imageproc```, and ```rand```.
