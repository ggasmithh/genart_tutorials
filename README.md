# what?
This is a short series of solutions of a generative art tutorial (linked below).
I implement them in the language suggested by the tutorial, and then (sometimes)
try and implement them in other languages (Rust and Python, so far).

# why?
I just miss working on art-oriented code. Following tutorials and actually doing the due diligence might be a way to get good at it!
