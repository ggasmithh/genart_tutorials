# what?
This is a short series of solutions of a generative art tutorial (linked below).
The twist is that, while I'm "implementing" (moreso imitating) the solutions as intended in Javascript, I'm also going back and re-implementing them in C++ and/or Rust.

# why?
I wanted to learn Javascript, I miss C++ and I want to learn Rust as inefficently as possible. Moreso, I just miss working on art-oriented code. Following tutorials and actually doing the due diligence might be a way to get good at it!

In the unlikely event that I actually pick up skills to later be exploited for capital, then all the better.
